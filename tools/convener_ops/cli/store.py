"""The store's two YAML files, read and written in the dialect the browser writes.

`instance/data/speakers.yml` and `instance/data/config.yml` are written by
this package and by `app/src/data/yaml.ts`, and both sides have to produce
the same bytes for the same records: a file rewritten by whichever wrote
last, in its own dialect, is a diff nobody made. So there is one writer
here rather than one per command, and `app/src/data/yaml.ts` is its other
half -- `tools/tests/fixtures/speakers-from-app.yml` is written by one and
read by the other.

`load` is the reading side, and it is here rather than beside a command
for the smaller reason: every command that opens one of these files wants
the same two-part answer, the document or the sentence saying why not.
